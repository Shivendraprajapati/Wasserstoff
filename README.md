## TECH STACK...
React Js

## Libraries...

    "apexcharts": "^3.37.2",
    "bootstrap": "^5.2.3",
    "node-sass": "^7.0.3",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-apexcharts": "^1.4.0",
    "react-bootstrap": "^2.7.2",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "react-icons": "^4.7.1",
    "react-router-dom": "^6.8.1",
    "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
    "recharts": "^2.5.0",
    "react-simple-maps": "^3.0.0",

## Approach...

1. Create a folder and inside them usingcommand create-react-app and named project name.
2. Install 'node-sass' for designing my component.
3. Install all the library and dependencies which are required in this project.

 After reading through the entire figma thoroughly I broke project into a small component and firstly I made Navbar, Footer, and sidebar after that I came to the MapDesign, Bar chart and Bubble chart for that I used react libraries which was mentioned above for navigetion I used "react-router-dom" library, for map I used "react-simple-map" library, and for barcharts I used "recharts" library for styling I used SASS. I faced challenges in making mapdesign compounents, bubblegraphs components, and barcharts components.
